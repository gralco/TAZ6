Assemblies in this folder are to be updated when a change is made to a part that may be found in it.
Assemblies will not update when a part is saved.
The part must be manually updated in the assembly.
Parts in the assemblies must have only one visable body.
to make one visible body use the "part" workbench's "create simple copy" then hide evrything except the simple copy and save.
